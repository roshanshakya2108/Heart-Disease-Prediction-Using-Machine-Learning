# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

With the increasing prevalence of heart disease, developing robust data-driven systems for early prediction and prevention has become crucial. Machine Learning offers powerful tools to predict heart disease with high accuracy, significantly enhancing the research and prevention efforts, ultimately helping more people lead healthier lives.

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a heart disease patient dataset, followed by data preprocessing and the training of various machine learning models. The models employed include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and others. The goal is to predict the presence of heart disease based on various patient parameters, framed as a binary classification problem.

# Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented:

- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
- Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Scikit-learn)
- Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
- Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
- XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
- Artificial Neural Network with one hidden layer (Keras)


## Best Accuracy Achieved:

88% using the Random Forest model
Dataset Used:

Heart Disease UCI Dataset (Kaggle)
This project, which I implemented in a Jupyter notebook, is also featured in my Kaggle kernel, "Binary Classification with Sklearn and Keras."
